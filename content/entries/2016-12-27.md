## The Lemniscate

*2016 Dec 27*

After creating a tilted parabola, I started looking into other types of graphs that are also loci of points. A *locus* is a set of all points fulfilling some specific condition, like the parabola, the locus of all points equidistant from the focus point and the directrix line. One simple locus is a circle, which is the locus of all points some given distance from another point, the center of the circle. Another example is the *ellipse*, which is the locus of all points the sum of whose distances from two foci is equal to a constant. Here is an example of what an ellipse might look like:

Another type of locus is the *hyperbola*, which is the locus of all points the difference of whose distances from each of two foci is equal to a constant. Here is a hyperbola:

After studying the ellipse and hyperbola for a only a short time, I began to get bored, because almost everything that there was to know about the ellipse and hyperbola was already discovered. So I decided to make my own locus, which was the locus of all points the product of whose distances from each of two foci was equal to a constant. I decided to let the foci be the points $(x_0,0)$ and $(-x_0,0)$ (so that it would be symmetric about the y-axis) and let this be equation of the locus:

$$\sqrt{y^2+(x-x_0)^2}*\sqrt{y^2+(x-x_0)^2}=c$$

As I played around with this graph, I found that it makes three basic types of shapes. The first consists of two disjoint closed curves that are vaguely egg-shaped,

the second consists of two pointed closed curves sharing a single point,

and the third consists of a single closed curve that is pinched in the middle.

In order to determine when it takes each of these shaped, I decided to define the line equidistant from each of the lemniscate's foci as the *axis* of the lemniscate. I could then classify each shape by the number of times it intersected its axis: the first shape does not intersect its axis, the second intersects it at $1$ point, and the third intersects it at $2$ points. I could then determine algebraically when each shape would occur by setting $x$ to $0$ (because when the lemniscate is symmetric about the y-axis, the points at which it intersects its axis are at $x=0$). Then I could obtain a simpler expression by solving for the y-position at which the lemniscate would intersect its axis: 

$$\sqrt{y^2+(-x_0)^2}*\sqrt{y^2+{x_0}^2}=c$$
$$\sqrt{y^2+{x_0}^2}*\sqrt{y^2+{x_0}^2}=c$$
$$y^2+{x_0}^2=c$$
$$y^2=c-{x_0}^2$$

Now, in order to generalize my findings for any lemnicate not necessarily lying on the x-axis or symmetric about the y-axis, I decided to let $d$ be the distance  between the foci so that $d=2x_0$ and ${x_0}^2=\frac{1}{4}d^2$, and I replaced
$$y^2=c-{x_0}^2$$
with
$$y^2=c-\frac{1}{4}d^2$$
Then I could easily determine when each of the shapes would be made because

1. When $c<\frac{1}{4}d^2$, $c-\frac{1}{4}d^2$ would be a negative number. This means that $y^2$ would have to be equal to a negative number, and there would be no real intersections between the lemniscate and its axis.

2. When $c=\frac{1}{4}d^2$, $c-\frac{1}{4}d^2$ would be zero. This means that $y^2$ would have to be equal to 0, and there would be exactly one intersection (i.e. at $y=0$).

3. When $c>\frac{1}{4}d^2$, $c-\frac{1}{4}d^2$ would be a positive number. This means that $y^2$ would have to be equal to a positive number, and there would be exactly two intersections with ordinates $y=+\sqrt{c-\frac{1}{4}d^2}$ and $y=-\sqrt{c-\frac{1}{4}d^2}$.

That's all I'm doing with the lemniscate for now, but it is a very interesting subject and I will surely return to it later.

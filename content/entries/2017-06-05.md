## A "Progression" Problem

*2017 June 5*

> Find all non-trivial sets of three numbers $[n_1,n_2,n_3]$ in arithmetic progression whose squares are in geometric progression. They need not be integers.

This problem doesn't take long. Here is the solution:

If these integers exist, then for some $n_1$, $r$, and $d$,
$$(x+d)^2=rx^2$$
and
$$(x+2d)^2=r(x+d)^2$$
We can treat these like a simultaneous system of equations. First, we can two expressions both equal to $r$:
$$\frac{(x+d)^2}{x^2}=r$$
$$\frac{(x+2d)^2}{(x+d)^2}=r$$
And since they are both equal to $r$, we can set them equal to each other, removing the $r$ variable from the equation.
$$\frac{(x+d)^2}{x^2}=\frac{(x+2d)^2}{(x+d)^2}$$
And, by cross multiplying, we obtain
$$x^2(x+2d)^2=(x+d)^4$$
I'll spare you the algebra and say that when we solve for $d$, we get
$$x=-d\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2d^2}$$
So the solution set is
$$[-d\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2d^2}, \pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2d^2},d\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2d^2}]$$

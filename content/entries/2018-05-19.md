## A Half-Exponential Integral

> Find some upper and lower bounds for the integral
$$\int_0^1 f(x)dx$$
given that $f:\mathbb R\mapsto\mathbb R$ is continuous, increasing, and that $f(f(x))=e^x$.

This is an interesting problem that I came up with while investigating half-exponential functions. I last investigated this type of function in [this post](/post/75) about fractional iterates of functions, and I posed this puzzle to the users of [Math Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2783000/recreational-math-if-ffx-ex-bound-the-integral-int-01-fxdx/2783858#2783858). In this short post, I will present my original solution to the problem.

As I showed in the previous post, the function $f(x)$ must be bounded above by $e^x$ and below by $x$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$. This implies that $0\lt f(0)\lt 1$. For convenience, I will let $f_0=f(0)$. To solve the problem, I will first split up the integral in question into
$$\int_0^1 f(x)dx=\int_0^{f_0} f(x)dx+\int_{f_0}^1 f(x)dx$$
Now, by making the substitution $x\to f(x)$ and using integration by parts in the second integral, we see that
$$\begin{align}
I:=\int_{f_0}^1 f(x)dx
&=\int_{0}^{f^{-1}(1)} f(f(x))f'(x)dx\\
&=\int_{0}^{f_0} e^xf'(x)dx\\
&=\big[e^xf(x)\big]_0^{f_0}-\int_{0}^{f_0} e^xf(x)dx\\
&=e^{f_0}-f_0-\int_{0}^{f_0} e^xf(x)dx\\
\end{align}$$
and so our original integral is equal to
$$I=e^{f_0}-f_0-\int_0^{f_0} (e^x-1)f(x)dx\tag{1}$$
Now consider the following integral:
$$\int_0^{f_0} (e^x-1)f(x)dx$$
It is always positive, because of the previously mentioned bounds for $f$. Furthermore, since $f$ is increasing, for all $x\in [0,f_0]$, we have that $f(x)\in [f_0,1]$. Thus, we have that
$$f_0\int_0^{f_0} (e^x-1)dx\lt\int_0^{f_0} (e^x-1)f(x)dx\lt \int_0^{f_0} (e^x-1)dx$$
...or, after simplifying the integrals in the upper and lower bounds,
$$f_0e^{f_0}-f_0^2-f_0\lt\int_0^{f_0} (e^x-1)f(x)dx\lt e^{f_0}-f_0-1$$
By combining this inequality with equation (1), we have that
$$1 \lt I\lt (1-f_0)e^{f_0}+f_0^2$$
It can be shown using basic calculus that for all $x\in [0,1]$, the quantity $(1-x)e^x+x^2$ is always less than or equal to $\ln^2(2)-2\ln(2)+2\approx 1.0942$. Thus, since $f_0\in [0,1]$, we have that
$$1 \lt I\lt \ln^2(2)-2\ln(2)+2$$
Not only are these bounds correct, but they are also the *best possible bounds*, in that there exist functions $f$ making the integral arbitrarily close to $1$ or $\ln^2(2)-2\ln(2)+2$. In order to make the integral arbitrarily close to $1$, one need only choose a function $f(x)$ such that $f(0)$ is arbitrarily close to $1$, and such that $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $1$ for $x\in [0,f(0)]$, so that the graph of $f$ for $0\le x\le 1$ looks very much like a horizontal line segment. Similarly, to make $I$ arbitrarily close to $\ln^2(2)-2\ln(2)+2$, one should choose $f$ such that $f(0)=\ln(2)$ and such that $f(x)$ is very close to $\ln(2)$ for $x\in [0,\ln(2)]$.

The solution to this puzzle concludes this (short) blog post! I shall leave a final puzzle for the reader which is slightly more difficult than the one solved in this post:

> Prove that
$$\frac{23}{27}\lt \int_0^1 g(x)dx\lt\frac{55}{54}$$
given that $g:\mathbb R\mapsto\mathbb R$ is continuous, increasing, and that $g(g(x))=x^2+1$.

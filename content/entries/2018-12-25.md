## Geometry with Platonic Solids

*2018 December 25*

In this post, I will calculate the surface area, volume, and dihedral angles for each of the five platonic solids: the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron.

Let's start with the tetrahedron.

It is elementary to show by the Pythagorean theorem that the area of an equilateral triangle is $\sqrt{3}/4$ times its squared side length, meaning that the surface area of the tetrahedron, having four equilateral triangular faces, is equal to $\sqrt{3} x^2$ if its side length is $x$. 

To calculate the volume of the tetrahedron, let us choose one face of the tetrahedron as the base, and notice that the distance from any vertex of the base triangle to the center of the base is equal to $x/\sqrt{3}$. Then draw a right triangle using the right angle drawn from a vertex of the base to the center of the base to the highest vertex of the tetrahedron. This triangle will look like this:

We can see by the pythagorean theorem that the height of the tetrahedron from its base is $x\sqrt{2/3}$. Thus, since the area of the base is $\sqrt{3}x^2/4$, we have that the volume of the whole tetrahedron is $x^3/6\sqrt{2}$.

Finally, we wish to calculate the angle between any two faces of the tetrahedron. To do this, we may make a planar cross-section through the tetrahedron passing through one vertex of the base and the midpoint of the opposite side, making a cross-section in the shape of the following triangle, where $\theta$ is the angle between two of the tetrahedron's faces:

By drawing an altitude from the bottom-right vertex to the opposite edge, we can see that $\theta=2\arcsin(1/\sqrt{3})=\arccos(1/3)$, giving us the desired angle.

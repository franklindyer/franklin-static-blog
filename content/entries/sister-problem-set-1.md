## Упражнения для сестры, часть 1

Do not use a calculator for any of these problems. <br>
    
Do your best to solve them, but if you get stuck and can't find an answer to all parts of a problem, don't worry. We can talk about it together, and you can always come back and try to solve it again later.

**Problem 1.** For each of the following equations, find at least one *integer* solution $x,y\in\mathbb Z$, or try to prove that none exists.

- $5x + 7y = 1$  
- $5x + 13y = 1$  
- $16x + 47y = 1$  
- $18x + 33y = 1$  
- $85x + 222y = 1$  
- $85x + 221y = 1$  

For example, an integer solution to the first equation is $(x,y)=(3,-2)$, because $3\cdot 5 - 2\cdot 7 = 1$. (You don't have to solve that one.)

**Problem 2.** $(1+\sqrt{2})^{10}$ is equal to $3363 + 2378\sqrt{2}$. Calculate the value of $(1-\sqrt{2})^{10}$.

**Problem 3.** Consider the following process: start with a natural number $n$, add up all of its digits in base $10$, and repeat the process with this new number. For example, if we start with the number $n=14832$, the sequence goes like this: $$14832 \to 18 \to 9 \to 9 \to 9 \to \cdots$$ In this case, it ends up repeating the number $9$ forever. Does this process always end with some number repeating itself forever? If so, can you prove it? If you use the starting value $$n = 7^{1001} = 877 ~ 269 ~ \cdots ~ 200 ~ 007$$ then will the sequence eventually repeat, and if so, what number will end up repeating forever?

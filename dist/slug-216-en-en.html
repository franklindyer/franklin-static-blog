    <h2>Totality and non-standard recursion in Idris</h2>

<p>Lately I've been continuing my adventures in dependent type theory and computer-verified proofs by working with the <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris language</a>. I've really enjoyed using Agda, but I think that Idris has started to appeal to me more because it feels like it strikes nice balance between practicality and more "academic" use cases, e.g. as a proof assistant. But I still consider myself a beginner at all of this stuff, so instead of arguing for the merits of Idris I'd like to talk about a specific interesting problem that I've solved recently. (You can find all of the code that I've written for this post in <a href="https://github.com/franklindyer/idris-math">this Github repo</a>.)</p>

<p>Idris has this neat feature called <a href="https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/theorems.html#totality-checking">totality checking</a>. A function is called <strong>total</strong> when it is guaranteed to terminate "eventually" for any possible input value you might pass it. Due to the uncomputability of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a>, it's not possible to look at an arbitrary function and decide algorithmically whether or not it can enter an infinite loop. But for certain <em>kinds</em> of recursive definitions that adhere to a specific pattern, it's possible to <em>confirm</em> that they define total functions. </p>

<p>For instance, they can generally verify that the following kind of definition is total:</p>

<div class="code"><code><pre>
f : Nat -> a
f 0     = x
f (S n) = g (f n)
</pre></code></div>

<p>where <code>x : a</code> is the base-case value of <code>f</code>, and <code>g : a -&gt; a</code> is some function that is iteratively applied to <code>x</code>. Totality checkers like this sort of definition because the argument <em>decreases by one</em> with each recursive call. If one of your function definitions can be seen to fit this pattern through static analysis, then it will get a big thumbs-up from the totality checker, because this is a known way of defining total functions on <code>Nat</code>.</p>

<p>Totality is <em>super important</em> when it comes to writing proofs. If you allow proofs to be non-total, then it's actually possible to prove anything at all! In Idris (and Agda) we represent "the false proposition" as the empty type, which in Idris is called <code>Void</code>. If you allow non-total proofs, then you can write the following recursive proof of "false", or equivalently, construct the following element <code>Void</code>:</p>

<div class="code"><code><pre>
x : Void
x = x
</pre></code></div>

<p>Yes, this is ridiculous. If someone asked you to prove a statement $P$, this would be equivalent to saying "sure thing! ask me tomorrow and I'll give you my proof". And then saying the same thing the next day, and the next day, and so on. If a language is meant to be used for proof verification, then it certainly should not allow this sort of thing to happen.</p>

<p>In Agda, this is not an issue because Agda is a <a href="https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/ReferenceManual/Totality">total language</a>, meaning that it <em>does not even allow you to write</em> definitions that it can't verify as total. This is good, but it has the inconvenient consequence that some functions can't be written at all in Agda - that is, it's not Turing Complete. Not only that, but many recursive functions that <em>are</em> total are actually significantly more difficult to write because the most straightforward way of writing them doesn't satisfy Agda's totality checker. Idris occupies a middle ground on this issue: it does not require <em>all</em> functions to be total, but you can annotate <em>specific</em> functions with the <code>total</code> keyword if you'd like Idris to make sure that they are total. Any proofs you write in Idris should be marked <code>total</code>.</p>

<p>To take a concrete example, consider the recursive function $L : \mathbb N\to \mathbb N$ defined by a base case of $L(0) = 0$ and the following recurrence: <script type="math/tex; mode=display">L(n) = 1 + L\big(\lfloor n/2\rfloor\big)</script> Incidentally, this function's explicit value is actually given as follows for arguments $n\neq 0$: <script type="math/tex; mode=display">L(n) = 1 + \lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor</script> In Idris, we can define this function directly using its recursive definition, just like this:</p>

<div class="code"><code><pre>
log2Careless : Nat -> Nat
log2Careless 0      = 0
log2Careless (S x)  = 1 + log2Careless (div2 $ S x)
</pre></code></div>

<p>where <code>div2</code> is a helper function I've written to compute the quantity $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$. This definition works fine in Idris, but if you were to write an analogous definition in Agda, it would yell at you because it doesn't recognize that this will always terminate. This is because its termination actually depends on the properties of the function <code>div2</code> involved in the recursive call. After all, if <code>div2</code> were, say, the identity function instead of $n\mapsto \lfloor n/2\rfloor$, then in fact this definition would give a <em>non-total</em> function. Similarly, if you try putting the <code>total</code> keyword before this definition in Idris, it would also yell at you, and for good reason.</p>

<p>So what if we want our cake <em>and</em> to eat it too? How can we write a function that both satisfies this recurrence <em>and</em> is a total function? After all, if we're going to be doing pure math in Idris, ideally all of the functions involved should be total.</p>

<p>Remember the example function we saw earlier, which is accepted by the totality checker because its argument decrements by one with each recursive call? We can mimic this behavior by adding a second accumulator-like argument to our function that also decrements by one wih each recursive call. The new definition looks like this:</p>

<div id="an-code-0" class="code annotated-code">total
ɑlog2CarefulHelper : Nat -> Nat -> Natβ
ɑlog2CarefulHelper _ 0 = 0β
ɑlog2CarefulHelper m (S n)β
    = ɑcaseSplitβ 
        ɑ(\_ => 1 + log2CarefulHelper (div2 m) n)β
        ɑ(\_ => log2CarefulHelper m n)β 
        ɑ(decLeq (S n) m)β 

total
ɑlog2Careful : Nat -> Natβ
log2Careful n = log2CarefulHelper n n
</div>

<p><span id="an-code-0-info" class="annotated-code-info"></span></p>

<p>This is definitely a more roundabout way of defining the same recursive function, and it's not obvious at first glance why it satisfies the same recurrence. I like to think about the difference between these two recursive definitions graphically: you might picture the sequence of recursive calls involved in computing $L(7)$ like this, for the "careless" recursive definition:</p>

<p><center><img src="/img/2024-03-20-Fig1.png" alt="Fig 1" /></center></p>

<p>and you might picture the sequence of recursive calls involved in computing $L(7)$ for the "careful" recursive definition like this:</p>

<p><center><img src="/img/2024-03-20-Fig2.png" alt="Fig 2" /></center></p>

<p>If it's not obvious to <em>us</em> that this function satisfies the same recurrence as $L$, then it almost certainly isn't obvious to Idris, either. This is the price we pay for making our function total: the recursive formula is <em>no longer part of its definition</em>, and therefore we actually have to write a proof to <em>convince</em> Idris that <code>log2Careful</code> satisfies the recurrence for $L$, if we want to have this fact at our disposal. The recurrence for <code>log2Careless</code> can be proved trivially because it's part of the definition:</p>

<div class="code"><code><pre>
log2CarelessRecurrence : (n : Nat) ->
                         log2Careless (S n) = 1 + log2Careless (div2 $ S n)
log2CarelessRecurrence n = Refl
</pre></code></div>

<p>But oops, if you try to mark this proof as <code>total</code>, Idris will complain that <code>log2Careless</code> may not a total function. And a proof that isn't necessarily total isn't of much value, as we've seen. So while <code>log2Careless</code> is much more natural to write, it doesn't play nice with proofs.</p>

<p>What we want, then, is to construct a proof of the following type:</p>

<div class="code"><code><pre>
log2CarefulRecurrence : (n : Nat) ->
                         log2Careful (S n) = 1 + log2Careful (div2 $ S n)
</pre></code></div>

<p>I'm not going to lie - this proof was a real pain in the butt and it took a lot of practice with proof assistants before I was capable of writing it. My first step was to prove an intermediate proposition about the <code>log2Careful</code> function, essentially stating that when the second argument is greater than the first argument, it can be "dropped down" to the value of the first argument without changing the function's value. You can see this pictorialy in our diagram representing the sequence of recursive calls for <code>log2Careful</code>, too. It's reflected in the fact that the arrows always move horizontally and to the left <em>until reaching the diagonal</em>. </p>

<p>Anyways, here's my proof of this lemma:</p>

<div id="an-code-1" class="code annotated-code">total
log2DropDown : (m, n : Nat) -> LeqNat m n -> log2CarefulHelper m n = log2CarefulHelper m m
ɑlog2DropDown 0 0 _ = Reflβ
ɑlog2DropDown 0 (S n) (LeqZero (S n))β
    = trans 
        ɑ(caseSplitNo 
            {y = 1 + log2CarefulHelper 0 n} 
            (decLeq (S n) 0) 
            (succNotLeqZero n))β 
        ɑ(log2DropDown 0 n (LeqZero n))β
ɑlog2DropDown (S m) (S n) (LeqShift leq1)β
    = ɑcaseSplitβ
        ɑ(\leq2 => cong (log2CarefulHelper <a>$</a> S m) (leqAntisym leq2 <a>$</a> LeqShift leq1))β
        (\nleq =>
            let ɑleq2 = leqImmediateSuc leq1 (\eq => nleq <a>$</a> LeqShift <a>$</a> eqImpliesLeq <a>$</a> sym eq)β in 
            trans
                ɑ(caseSplitNo (decLeq (S n) (S m)) nleq)β
                ɑ(log2DropDown (S m) n leq2))β
        ɑ(decLeq (S n) (S m))β

</div>

<p><span id="an-code-1-info" class="annotated-code-info"></span></p>

<p>Lemma in hand, the rest of the proof is not so bad. Here's what it looks like:</p>

<div id="an-code-2" class="code annotated-code">total
ɑlog2CarefulRecurrence : (n : Nat) -> log2Careful (S n) = 1 + log2Careful (div2 $ S n)β
log2CarefulRecurrence n =
    trans
        ɑ(caseSplitYes (decLeq (S n) (S n)) (eqImpliesLeq Refl))β
        ɑ(cong (1+) <a>$</a> log2DropDown (div2 <a>$</a> S n) n (div2Leq n))β
</div>

<p><span id="an-code-2-info" class="annotated-code-info"></span></p>

<p>This whole ordeal was painfully gruelling for such a simple-looking recurrence relation, so of course I immediately wanted to rewrite these proofs in as abstract of a form as possible, so that in the future I could just appeal to my abstract proof for any additional recurrences without having to think through this whole ordeal again. My "recurrence template" looks pretty similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)">foldr higher-order function</a>, with just a couple of differences. </p>

<p>Firstly, it requires that the domain type <code>a</code> be endowed with some sort of "size function" that assigns to each element of <code>a</code> a natural number representing its "size". This is necessary to express the idea of a "well-founded" recurrence. In order to guarantee that a recursive definition of a function on an arbitrary domain terminates, we need some way of saying that each function value is recursively defined in terms of a function value at a "smaller" input. And this is predicated on there existing some notion of size for elements of <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>Secondly, it allows for <em>multiple base cases</em> of the function to be defined. In particular, the base <em>cases</em> are defined to be precisely the elements of <code>a</code> whose size equals zero. There can be multiple such elements, and they are all of the preimages of <code>0 : Nat</code> under the <code>size</code> function.</p>

<p>Analogously to the drawings we saw earlier describing how the <code>log2</code> functions' recursive definitions progress from one input to the next, we might picture the sequence of recursive calls involved in this kind of generalized recurrence as follows:</p>

<p><center><img src="/img/2024-03-20-Fig3.png" alt="Fig 3" /></center></p>

<p>So, to completely describe a recurrence defining a recursive function <code>a -&gt; b</code>, we need a function <code>recg : a -&gt; b -&gt; b</code> which is a direct analogue of the function passed as an argument to <code>foldr</code>; a function <code>recf : a -&gt; a</code> specifying which element of <code>a</code> is to be the "previous case" for any given element of <code>a</code>; a function <code>size : a -&gt; Nat</code> assigning a quantitative size to each possible input; and a function <code>base : a -&gt; b</code> mapping each size-zero input value with the base-case value that should be assigned to it. My design choice was to bundle all of these data into a record type, like this:</p>

<div class="code"><code><pre>
public export
record GenericRecurrence a b where
    constructor MakeGenRec
    size : a -> Nat
    base : a -> b
    recf : a -> a
    recg : a -> b -> b 
</pre></code></div>

<p>The "careless" way of defining a recursive function from these data is implemented like this:</p>

<div class="code"><code><pre>
public export
carelessNatRecurse : GenericRecurrence a b -> (a -> b)
carelessNatRecurse gr x
    = if (gr.size x) == 0 
      then gr.base x 
      else gr.recg x (carelessNatRecurse gr (gr.recf x))
</pre></code></div>

<p>This is very similar to the definition of <code>foldr</code>! Sadly, much like our <code>log2Careless</code> function, Idris does not recognize this as <code>total</code> (and for good reason, as it may not be total at all depending on the <code>recf</code> function). So here is my "careful" version of the same function, which Idris <em>does</em> recognize as being total:</p>

<div class="code"><code><pre>
total
carefulHelper : GenericRecurrence a b -> (a -> Nat -> Nat -> b)
carefulHelper gr x s 0 = gr.base x
carefulHelper gr x s (S k)
    = caseSplit
        (\_ => gr.recg x (carefulHelper gr (gr.recf x) (gr.size $ gr.recf x) k))
        (\_ => carefulHelper gr x s k)
        (decLeq (S k) s)

total
public export
carefulNatRecurse : GenericRecurrence a b -> (a -> b)
carefulNatRecurse gr x = carefulHelper gr x (gr.size x) (gr.size x)
</pre></code></div>

<p>As before, Idris can't figure out on its own that recursive functions defined using <code>carefulNatRecurse</code> satisfy the recurrence they're supposed to satisfy, so it requires a proof on my part. The proof is pretty similar to the one I wrote for <code>log2Careful</code> and just as unwieldy, so I won't include it here. However, it has an interesting difference in the <em>type signature</em> that is worth pointing out. (But if you're curious, you can see the <a href="https://github.com/franklindyer/idris-math/blob/main/Recursion.idr">source code here</a>.) The type signature looks like this:</p>

<div id="an-code-3" class="code annotated-code">total
public export
carefulNatRecurrence : ɑ(gr : GenericRecurrence a b)β ->
                        ɑ(bound : (x : a) -> 
                                 (n : Nat) -> 
                                 (gr.size x = S n) -> 
                                 LeqNat (gr.size (gr.recf x)) n)β ->
                        ɑ(x : a) ->
                        (n : Nat) ->
                        (gr.size x = S n)β ->
                        ɑ(carefulNatRecurse gr x = gr.recg x (carefulNatRecurse gr $ gr.recf x))β
</div>

<p><span id="an-code-3-info" class="annotated-code-info"></span></p>

<p>The difference is that we need to actually provide <em>as an additional argument</em> the boundedness property of <code>recf</code> guaranteeing that it reduces input sizes with each recursive call. We didn't need this when proving <code>log2CarefulRecurrence</code> because we were working with a <em>specific</em> recurrence, in which the recursive calls were to arguments of half the size. For this specific case, I had already proven the boundedness property of <code>div2</code> as a lemma called <code>div2Leq</code>, but in the more general case, this lemma would have to be passed as an argument.</p>

<p>Finally, here's what the whole definition of $L$ looks like when using my abstracted recursion scheme, rather than doing the whole proof by hand.</p>

<div id="an-code-4" class="code annotated-code">total
ɑlog2RecursionPackage : GenericRecurrence Nat Natβ
log2RecursionPackage = MakeGenRec ɑidβ ɑidβ ɑdiv2β ɑ(\_ => (1+))β

total
ɑlog2 : Nat -> Nat
log2 = carefulNatRecurse log2RecursionPackageβ

total
ɑlog2Recurrence : (n : Nat) -> log2 (S n) = 1 + log2 (div2 (S n))β
log2Recurrence n 
    = carefulNatRecurrence
        ɑlog2RecursionPackageβ
        ɑ(\sm, m, eq => transport (\k => LeqNat (div2 k) m) (sym eq) (div2Leq m))β
        (S n) n Refl
</div>

<p><span id="an-code-4-info" class="annotated-code-info"></span></p>

<p>Pretty handy, right?</p>
